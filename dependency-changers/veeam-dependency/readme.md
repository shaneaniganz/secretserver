# Introduction

This document details configuring a dependency changer for the credentials managed in VEEAM Backup and Replication software. How you handle accounts for Windows and Linux can vary. This specific use case follows the pattern that a Windows and Linux credential are the same, with the exception Windows will have `domain\` and Linux will not.

The script is written in a manner that lets you control whether you want to rotate the password for both types or just Windows.

As with all PowerShell script dependencies, you must have WINRM configured to allow Secret Server to execute the scripts. [For more information see Delinea documentation](https://docs.delinea.com/online-help/secret-server/api-scripting/configuring-winrm-powershell/index.htm). A **Default PowerShell RunAs Secret** with access to run a PowerShell session on the Distributed Engined must be added to the site running the dependency.

## VEEAM PowerShell Snap-in

VEEAM utilizes a [PowerShell Snap-in](https://helpcenter.veeam.com/docs/backup/powershell/getting_started.html) that is included in the [installation media](https://www.veeam.com/kb1489). This script can be modified to run locally on the web node or Distributed Engine, or against a VEEAM server that already has the snap-in installed. The steps below utilize a remote server.

## Create Script

1. Navigate to **Admin | Scripts**
2. Enter name: **VEEAM Dependency**
3. Description: **`Script for rotating credential in VEEAM | https://github.com/thycotic-ps/secretserver/tree/main/dependency-changers/veeam-dependency`**
4. Category: **Dependency**
5. Script: **Copy and Paste** the provided script [veeam-dependency-remote.ps1](veeam-dependency-remote.ps1)
6. Click **OK**

## Create Dependency

1. Navigate to your desired secret
2. Navigate to **Dependencies** tab
3. Create a **New Dependency** (_create a dependency group if one does not currently exist_)
4. Click the drop-down for **Type**
5. Select the **VEEAM Dependency** under the **Run PowerShell Script** section
6. Provide a **Dependency Name**
7. Select a **Run As** secret if required according to your Secret Server configuration
8. Enter **5** for **Wait(s)**
9. Arguments enter `$[1]$USERNAME $[1]$PASSWORD $MACHINE $DOMAIN $USERNAME $PASSWORD $NOTES`
10. Click **Save**

## Add associated secret 
Once you have built the dependency, an associated secret with permission to log in as an administrator on the Veeam server must be added to the secret at position #1.
